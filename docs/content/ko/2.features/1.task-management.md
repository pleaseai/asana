# Task Management

Comprehensive task management features for creating, listing, completing, and deleting Asana tasks from the command line.

## Create Tasks

### Basic Task Creation

Create a simple task with just a name:

```bash
bun run dev task create -n "Task name" -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

### Task with Description

```bash
bun run dev task create \
  -n "Implement authentication" \
  -d "Add OAuth 2.0 and JWT support for user authentication" \
  -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

### Task in a Project

Assign a task to a specific project:

```bash
bun run dev task create \
  -n "Fix login bug" \
  -p PROJECT_ID \
  -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

### Task with Assignee

Assign a task to a specific user:

```bash
bun run dev task create \
  -n "Review code changes" \
  -a USER_ID \
  -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

### Task with Due Date

Set a deadline for the task:

```bash
bun run dev task create \
  -n "Submit quarterly report" \
  --due 2025-12-31 \
  -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

### Complete Task Creation

Create a task with all options:

```bash
bun run dev task create \
  -n "Update user documentation" \
  -d "Add examples and screenshots to user guide" \
  -p PROJECT_ID \
  -a USER_ID \
  --due 2025-11-30 \
  -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

## List Tasks

### List Your Tasks

View all tasks assigned to you:

```bash
bun run dev task list -a me -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

### List Project Tasks

View all tasks in a specific project:

```bash
bun run dev task list -p PROJECT_ID
```

### Include Completed Tasks

By default, only incomplete tasks are shown. Include completed tasks:

```bash
bun run dev task list -a me -c -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

### List Tasks for Another User

View tasks assigned to a specific user:

```bash
bun run dev task list -a USER_ID -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

## View Task Details

Get detailed information about a specific task:

```bash
bun run dev task get TASK_ID
```

This displays:

- Task name
- Description
- Assignee
- Due date
- Projects
- Completion status
- Created and modified dates

## Complete Tasks

Mark a task as complete:

```bash
bun run dev task complete TASK_ID
```

The task will be marked as completed but remains in the system for record-keeping.

## Delete Tasks

Permanently delete a task:

```bash
bun run dev task delete TASK_ID
```

::alert{type="warning"}
**Warning**: This action cannot be undone. The task will be permanently removed from Asana.

## Command Options

### Common Options

All task commands support these options:

- `-w, --workspace <id>` - Workspace ID (required for most operations)
- `-p, --project <id>` - Project ID
- `-a, --assignee <id>` - User ID or "me" for yourself

### Create Options

- `-n, --name <string>` - Task name (required)
- `-d, --description <string>` - Task description
- `--due <date>` - Due date (YYYY-MM-DD format)

### List Options

- `-c, --completed` - Include completed tasks

## Practical Examples

### Daily Standup Workflow

```bash
# Check your tasks for today
bun run dev task list -a me -w WORKSPACE_ID

# Create follow-up tasks
bun run dev task create -n "Follow up on PR review" -w WORKSPACE_ID

# Complete finished tasks
bun run dev task complete TASK_ID
```

### Project Management

```bash
# View all project tasks
bun run dev task list -p PROJECT_ID

# Add new task to project
bun run dev task create \
  -n "Implement search feature" \
  -p PROJECT_ID \
  -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

### Team Collaboration

```bash
# Assign task to team member
bun run dev task create \
  -n "Review API documentation" \
  -a TEAM_MEMBER_ID \
  --due 2025-10-30 \
  -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

## Tips & Best Practices

::alert{type="success"}
**Pro Tip**: Use environment variables to avoid repeating workspace IDs:

```bash
export ASANA_WORKSPACE=your_workspace_id
```

Then you can omit the `-w` flag in many commands (depending on implementation).
::

::alert{type="info"}
**Finding IDs**:

- Workspace ID: Check the URL when viewing your workspace in Asana
- Project ID: Look at the URL when viewing a project
- User ID: Available through the Asana API or web interface
