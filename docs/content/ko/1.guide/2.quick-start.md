# Quick Start

Master the essential commands to manage your tasks efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you're authenticated:

```bash
bun run dev auth whoami
```

If not, see the [Getting Started](/en/guide/getting-started) guide.

## Basic Commands

### Create a Task

Create a simple task:

```bash
bun run dev task create -n "Review pull request" -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

Create a task with description:

```bash
bun run dev task create \
  -n "Implement user authentication" \
  -d "Add OAuth 2.0 and JWT support" \
  -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

Create a task in a project:

```bash
bun run dev task create \
  -n "Fix login bug" \
  -p PROJECT_ID \
  -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

Create a task with assignee and due date:

```bash
bun run dev task create \
  -n "Update documentation" \
  -a USER_ID \
  --due 2025-12-31 \
  -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

### List Tasks

List your tasks:

```bash
bun run dev task list -a me -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

List tasks in a project:

```bash
bun run dev task list -p PROJECT_ID
```

Include completed tasks:

```bash
bun run dev task list -a me -c -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

### View Task Details

Get detailed information about a task:

```bash
bun run dev task get TASK_ID
```

### Complete a Task

Mark a task as complete:

```bash
bun run dev task complete TASK_ID
```

### Delete a Task

Permanently delete a task:

```bash
bun run dev task delete TASK_ID
```

## Authentication Commands

### Check Current User

Verify who you're logged in as:

```bash
bun run dev auth whoami
```

### Logout

Clear stored credentials:

```bash
bun run dev auth logout
```

### Re-login

Switch accounts or refresh credentials:

```bash
bun run dev auth login --token NEW_TOKEN
```

## Using the Compiled Binary

If you've built the standalone executable:

```bash
# Build once
bun run build

# Then use the binary
./asana auth login --token YOUR_TOKEN
./asana task list -a me
./asana task create -n "New task"
./asana task complete TASK_ID
```

## Environment Variables

Set default values to avoid repetitive flags:

```bash
# Set Personal Access Token
export ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token

# Set default workspace
export ASANA_WORKSPACE=workspace_id

# Now you can use shorter commands
bun run dev task list -a me
```

## Common Workflows

### Morning Task Review

```bash
# Check what's on your plate
bun run dev task list -a me -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

### Create and Assign Task

```bash
# Create a task and assign it
bun run dev task create \
  -n "Code review for PR #123" \
  -a TEAM_MEMBER_ID \
  --due 2025-10-25 \
  -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

### Bulk Task Completion

```bash
# Complete multiple tasks
bun run dev task complete TASK_ID_1
bun run dev task complete TASK_ID_2
bun run dev task complete TASK_ID_3
```

## Tips & Tricks

::alert{type="success"}
**Pro Tip**: Set up shell aliases for frequently used commands:

```bash
alias asana-me="bun run dev task list -a me -w WORKSPACE_ID"
alias asana-create="bun run dev task create -w WORKSPACE_ID"
alias asana-done="bun run dev task complete"
```
::

::alert{type="info"}
**Finding IDs**: You can find workspace, project, and user IDs in the Asana web interface URL or by using the Asana API.
