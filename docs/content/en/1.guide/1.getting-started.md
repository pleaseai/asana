# Getting Started

Get up and running with Asana CLI in minutes.

## Installation

Choose the installation method that works best for you:

### Method 1: Homebrew (macOS/Linux - Recommended)

The easiest installation method for macOS and Linux users:

```bash
# Install from tap
brew install pleaseai/tap/asana-cli

# Or in two steps:
brew tap pleaseai/tap
brew install asana-cli

# Verify installation
asana --version
```

### Method 2: Install Script (All Platforms)

One-line installation for macOS and Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pleaseai/asana/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

The install script automatically:

- Detects your OS and architecture (macOS/Linux, x64/arm64)
- Downloads the latest release
- Verifies checksum
- Installs to `~/.local/bin`

**Note:** After installation, add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH if needed:

```bash
# For bash
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc

# For zsh
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### Method 3: From Source (Development)

For development or contributing to the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pleaseai/asana.git
cd asana
bun install
```

#### Build Executable (Optional)

To compile a standalone binary:

```bash
bun run build
```

This creates an `asana` executable that can run without Bun installed.

## Authentication

Asana CLI supports two authentication methods:

### Method 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

The quickest and simplest method, perfect for personal use and CLI tools.

#### Step 1: Generate Token

1. Go to [Asana Developer Console](https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps)
2. Create a new Personal Access Token
3. Copy the token

#### Step 2: Login with Token

```bash
# Development mode
bun run dev auth login --token YOUR_TOKEN

# Or with compiled binary
./asana auth login --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

#### Step 3: Set Default Workspace (Optional)

```bash
bun run dev auth login --token YOUR_TOKEN -w WORKSPACE_ID
```

### Method 2: OAuth 2.0

For multi-user applications or enhanced security requirements.

#### Step 1: Create OAuth App

1. Go to [Asana Developer Console](https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps)
2. Create a new OAuth application
3. Set Redirect URI to: `http://localhost:8080/callback`
4. Copy Client ID and Client Secret

#### Step 2: Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your credentials:

```bash
ASANA_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
ASANA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

Or set environment variables directly:

```bash
export ASANA_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
export ASANA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

#### Step 3: Login with OAuth

```bash
bun run dev auth login
```

Your browser will automatically open to the Asana authorization page.

## Verify Installation

Check your authentication status:

```bash
bun run dev auth whoami
```

You should see your Asana user information.

## Updating Asana CLI

Keep your CLI up-to-date to get the latest features and bug fixes.

### Homebrew Users

```bash
brew upgrade asana-cli
```

### Install Script Users

Use the built-in self-update command:

```bash
asana self-update
```

The `self-update` command automatically:

- Checks GitHub Releases for the latest version
- Downloads and verifies the new version
- Performs automatic update with rollback on failure

#### Check for Updates Only

To check if an update is available without installing:

```bash
asana self-update --check
```

### From Source

```bash
cd asana
git pull origin main
bun install
bun run build
```
